## Make the most of your `WebView`

What’s a WebView? A WebView is like full-screen browser inside a native app where you can run HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Crosswalk provides predictability on Android.

### By default

When you choose the default WebView, your users could be using the latest version of Android or seeing the web from 2011—or anywhere else inbetween.

### Upgraded with Crosswalk

Include Intel Crosswalk in your app, and all your users will see your app at its best: through a predictable, powerful WebView based on the latest version of Google Chromium.

> The bulk of our user interactions occur on the HTML5 front end. …we see almost around 1,000 different devices streaming Netflix on Android every day.

## Which `WebView` are you choosing?

Stop choosing a fragmented development enivronment. Over 1.3 million Android device are activated every, each with an slightly different interpretation of the web.

It’s impossible to imagine and painful to test how your native hybrid app will render or perform in every situation if you’ve chosen the default Android `WebView`.

#### Use Crosswalk and build great interfaces

Use new features confidently. Crosswalk supports otherwise unpredictable properties and APIs, whether they are in CSS or JavaScript.

#### Use Device APIs, with or without CordovaWhether your using Cordova or not, the Crosswalk supports the Geolocation API, the File API, the vibraton API and more.

#### Flexbox is ready with Crosswalk
