## What web view are you using?

Dropping support for  is one option, but it reduces your app’s reach and doesn’t solve the problem. Significant fragmentation exists event within the latest version of Android—there will still be unpredictability.

Amol KherFormer Engineer Manager at Netflix said

> The bulk of our user interactions occur on the HTML5 front end. …we see almost around 1,000 different devices streaming Netflix on Android every day.

## Does your `WebView` power reliable apps?

Chances are, your customers use as many different Android devices as Netflix’s, but see as many different devices as Netflix, but not have the resources or support to test like them.With Crosswalk, your app will render the same across every Android 4.0 device, so you can efficiently develop more predictable and performant apps.__[Get started with Cordova](#)__ or [start with Android](#)***
