Chrome has seen a ton of improvements on Android, especially over the past year. But running on old web views means you can’t take advantage of these improvements. That’s where the Intel Crosswalk open source project comes in.

The Crosswalk Project provides an embed double Chromium web view for Android versions as far back as Ice Cream Sandwich.

Using Crosswalk, Hybrid applications can run on the latest version of Chromium, regardless of Android version.

Similarly on iOS, the web view has seen great updates since version 6. And now with iOS 8

It’s finally possible to build hybrid apps that use a modern web view and run on almost every Android and iOS device released within the past three years.
