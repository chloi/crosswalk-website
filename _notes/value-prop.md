- Crosswalk supports Woff which as you can see Android has horrible support for. This would be appealing to designers as Web Typography is taking off in a big way. http://caniuse.com/#search=Woff
- Web Audio is super useful for game development. Again, abysmal support on native Android. http://caniuse.com/#search=Web%20Audio
- There are some features such as flexbox, position sticky, and position fixed that Crosswalk supports which is a huge pain-point in application development.

## Bob

- Competitive performance
- Fully open source, even for commercial products
- A roadmap with regular updates, strong support
- Predictable behavior:  When bundled with your app, you control the runtime and update process, not the OS. 
- Access to Cordova plugins
- Integrated with the Intel XDK Web Application Development Studio
- Crosswalk will give them webrtc, which enables multi-player games

## Alexis

- I would add for the updates part that we follow Chromium so it's not just "regular" it's every 6 weeks!!!! One can do regular updates but we bring major updates with bunch of new features every time (from chromium).
- Presentation API, SIMD
