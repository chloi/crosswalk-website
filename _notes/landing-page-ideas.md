## What `WebView` are you using?

With 2.4 million Android device are activated every day, and [X] active versions of Android, it’s impossible to imagine and painful to test how your native `WebView` or hybrid app will render or perform. So, what `WebView` are you using?

### Can’t I just limit support to the latest versions?

Dropping support for  is one option, but it reduces your app’s reach and doesn’t solve the problem. Significant fragmentation exists event within the latest version of Android—there will still be unpredictability.

## What if

Crosswalk is a futuristic replacement for Android’s `WebView` that also works with hybrid apps using Cordova / PhoneGap.

Dropping support for older versions of Android, or struggling to support them aren’t the only options. By bundling Crosswalk 

Bundle the Intel Crosswalk as your native app’s `WebView` or alongside Cordova and get:

- A predictable environment, even on Android 2.x
- Access to Chrome Dev Tools, even on Android 2.x [confirm]
- Frequent  `WebView` updates to your app’s updates, not Android releases
- Use the features you’ve been holding off on using
- Use future features  you’ve been looking forward to using

#### [For developers directly writing code]

I did a quick control scheme hack on RocketFist [with Crosswalk] and the results are amazing! Running at a staggering 60 fps with huge amounts of particles on screen on a Galaxy S3. So the gameplay is horrible like this, but it runs. And fast!
This opens a lot of creative possibilities. I’m so excited about this!

You might see as many different devices as Netflix, but not have the resources or support to test like them. With Crosswalk, you’ll be able to efficiently develop more predictable and performant apps, whether you have as many users as Netflix or are just getting started.

Build Android app like you’re from the future

Crosswalk is a powerful replacement for Android’s native WebView. Reliably develop native and Apache Cordova / PhoneGap apps using the HTML5 features you want: Web Audio, WebGL, web fonts, and more.

[If we go this route: use some sort of “built with Chrome / Blink” badge. Could also do “Works with Apache Cordova / PhoneGap badge, but might want to treat that alongside Construct 2]

Crosswalk is a powerful replacement for Android’s native WebView, so you can reliably develop apps using bleeding-edge HTML5 features and APIs.

Based on Google Chrome and Blink, Crosswalk gives your mobile game, in-app browser, or Apache Cordova / PhoneGap app access to Web Audio, WebGL, web fonts, and a lot more.

You might see as many different devices as Netflix, but not have the resources or support to test like them. With Crosswalk, you’ll be able to efficiently develop more predictable and performant apps, whether you have as many users as Netflix or are just getting started.

Chances are, your customers are using just as many different devices, and it maybe  be difficult or impossible to test how each is different.

With Crosswalk, your app will render the same across every Android 4.0 device, so you can efficiently develop more predictable and performant apps.

One less unknown in hybrid app development
A frame that’s worth a thousand pictures
The browser you wish you were always developing for
Give everyone the browser you wished they were using

You can’t make them use the browser you want, but you can make them use 

(Some sort of play on ever green browsers, but using a different metaphor?)

What if you could control what browsers visited your site?

You can’t control what browsers visit your site, but you can control what web view houses your app.

You might not get a say on what browser visits your site, but you can control what web view houses your app.

Less QA, less testing, getting to production faster,
You have less complexity (less conditional code)
Less risk at 

A hybrid app is only as good as its web view

You could upgrade from Cordova 2 to Cordova 3.5 and it might not make from, but if you upgrade to Crosswalk, you can actually get new features

At this point, all painful parts of hybrid app development come from the environment or the web view.

Hybrid app development’s last roadblock

The same way browsers compete, maybe web views should be competing, and they are trying to make the best one

Give your users the app you intended
Give your users the web view you developed on
Your app without the Crosswalk
“Until Crosswalk, my application development was full of compromises due to Android fragmentation”

Crosswalk makes Android fragmentation a moot point

We should definitely be calling it a web view because that’s what the native app development community calls it (ex. Instapaper’s article view would literally be instantiating a web view)

It’s a native tool that’s compatible with Cordova, not the other way around

Makes Android web views predictable

## Hierarchy for site

1. Lead in
2. CTA: __See it in action__ (video)
3. Problem? Lowest common denominator, Android fragmentation, etc. (info graphic style, show what versions of android remain and what features are missing in each version web view)
What web view are you using?
(once they get this panel, the answer they should have is “I don’t know!”)
There’s 1.5 million active android devices…etc.
4. “What Crosswalk gives you.” Specifics of the APIs that become available to you (with testimonial of how important those features are, ex. an authority on WebGL saying how important WebGL is under the game persona, even if they don’t use Crosswalk)
5. Fully compatible with Cordova (maybe has its own CTA, “Compatable with Cordova,” with little bot, plus little logos, works with Telerik, XDK, PhoneGap, etc.
(Maybe this section is actually 2 up, “For hybrid / Cordova / PhoneGap app devs, and for Android devs”, this is also the last call to action, “Get started with Cordova,” or “Get started with native Android”)
