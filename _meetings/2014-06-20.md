# Meeting notes

- We’re working with Google get Crosswalk more tightly integrated into their SDK and the whole Google Build
- Nothing that makes them look bad, but we can probably use their icons then and stuff
- Likes the short and sweet quotes that aren’t marginalised

What WebView did you choose for your app’s users?

{Also had the one idea to use many photos, remind people how many people using their app this was impacting, and then all but one aggressively cropped one fade away.}
