  <h2>Make the most of your WebView</h2>
  <p>What’s a WebView? A WebView is a full-screen browser inside a native app where you can run HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. If you’re using Apache Cordova, it’s the foundation of your app. WebViews are also used as in-app browser and alongside native components.</p>
  <h3>By default</h3>
  <p>When you choose the default Android <code>WebView</code>, your users could have the latest features or be seeing the web from 2011—or anywhere else inbetween.</p>
  <h3>Upgraded with Crosswalk</h3>
  <p>Include Intel Crosswalk in your app, and all your users will see your app at its best: through a predictable, powerful <code>WebView</code> based on the latest version of Google Chromium.</p>

      </footer>
      <p>The bulk of our user interactions occur on the HTML5 front end. …we see almost around 1,000 different devices streaming Netflix on Android every day.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <h2>Which <code>WebView</code> are you choosing?</h2>
    <p>Stop choosing a fragmented development enivronment. Over 1.3 million Android device are activated every, each with an slightly different interpretation of the web.</p>
    <div>
      <p>It’s impossible to imagine and painful to test how your native hybrid app will render or perform in every situation if you’ve chosen the default Android <code>WebView</code>.</p>
      <h4>Use Crosswalk and build great interfaces</h4>
      <p>Crosswalk fully support properties that are otherwise unpredictable, like position: fixed, and brand new ones that makes this even easier, like position: sticky. (TODO)</p>
      <h4>Use Device APIs, with or without Cordova</h4>
      <p>Whether your using Cordova or not, the Crosswalk supports the Geolocation API, the File API, the vibraton API and more.</p>
      <h4>Use Flexbox today, even on old versions of Android</h4>
      <p>Reliably build responsive user interfaces with Flexbox. Your app will render it properly on any Android 4.0+ device when Crosswalk is included.</p>
